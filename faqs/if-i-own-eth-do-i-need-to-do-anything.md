No! All ETH on the Eth 1.0 proof-of-work (PoW) chain will automatically become ETH on the
Eth 2.0 proof-of-stake (PoS) chain once "The Merge" occurs. Users will experience no change
in their day-to-day experience using Ethereum — all changes related to "The Merge" are "under the hood" and
related to the consensus mechanism that secures the network.
