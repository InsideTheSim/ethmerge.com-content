In proof-of-work (PoW) whoever solves the block first gets the reward. Simply put, proof-of-work (PoW) is a race. If you have more hash rate than your competitors you are more likely to win. The end result of this arms race is that proof-of-work (PoW) miners run as many GPUs as they can at 100% load, 24-hours-a-day. This extreme power demand [continues to grow](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/bitcoin-energy-use-mined-the-gap) with the price of the block rewards they are attempting to earn.

Alternatively, in proof-of-stake (PoS) block proposers are [randomly selected](https://benjaminion.xyz/eth2-annotated-spec/phase0/beacon-chain/#compute_proposer_index) — completely removing the requirement for an arms race. There is no way to increase the likelihood that any specific node is chosen to propose a block — so there is no need to consume more and more energy to improve your competitive chances.

Because proof-of-stake (PoS) nodes are estimated to be [99%](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent) (or [more](https://twitter.com/sigp_io/status/1374979655782989824)) more efficient their proof-of-work (PoW) counterparts, proof-of-stake (PoS) represents a massive leap forward for the energy efficiency of blockchain technology.
