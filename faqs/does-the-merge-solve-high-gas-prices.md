No. "The Merge" is limited in scope to upgrading Ethereum's consensus mechanism. In practice it will not have any effect on the current user experience of Ethereum today. Future updates on the Ethereum roadmap such as [sharding,](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/) _will_ directly help to improve gas prices. At this time sharding is considered to be a [lower priority](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/278) than "The Merge" — which eliminates wasteful proof-of-work (PoW) energy inefficiency — by a majority of the Ethereum community.
