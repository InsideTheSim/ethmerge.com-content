**Short Answer:**<br>
The target date for the merge is September 15th with a TTD of 58750000000000000000000. A live estimate is calculated here https://bordel.wtf/.

**Long Answer:**<br>
The TTD (Terminal Total Difficulty) was agree'd in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJaCaS0WbIw">Ethereum All Core Devs call #145</a> with a TTD of 58750000000000000000000. This is estimated to occur on September 15th with some variance in time of up to a few days due to fluctuations in network hashrate.

The Ethereum PoS chain is currently running and will undergo its mainnet-ready hardfork, codenamed Bellatrix, on September 6th at epoch 144896.
