The miners will be replaced by validators after the merge. Part of the gas fees the user pays will be burned. The rest will be given to a validator who confirms the transactions and includes them in the next block. With EIP-1559 this mechanism will be implemented in summer 2021 on Ethereum 1 and is already included by default in Ethereum 2. This will reduce gas fees especially with high network usage. More information of Ethereum's gas fees as well as EIP-1559 can be found in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/okcoin-blog/how-will-ethereum-2-0-staking-eip-1559-affect-the-value-of-eth-e1a397010b68)
