Ethereum in its current state is using [Proof of Work (PoW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EUAcxhuoU4) to ensure consensus amongst the thousands of nodes of the network, while reliable and secure, this method is also very energy intensive since each block to be included on the blockchain needs to be computed by the nodes using a GPU to solve a complex mathematical problem.

[Proof of stake (PoS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psKDXvXdr7k) guarantees the security in a different way, allowing anyone staking 32 ETH in its node to propose blocks, should a malicious actor try to temper with the underlying protocol by proposing bad block, their funds would be slashed, meaning they lose a portion of their ether. If you attack a PoW network, the only cost is the wasted electricity. Attacking PoS can be compared to a miner's rig catching on fire everytime they try to attack.

This new method doesn't require a energy-intensive process like PoW, any relatively recent computer staking 32 ETH could run the software.

The estimated energy saved by switching the consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS is estimated to be around 99%+ [source1](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent) [source2](https://twitter.com/sigp_io/status/1374979655782989824)
