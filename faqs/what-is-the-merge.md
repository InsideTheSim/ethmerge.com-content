"The Merge" is an upgrade to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) that swaps out the current [proof-of-work (PoW)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) consensus mechanism with a more eco-friendly, efficient, and secure [proof-of-stake (PoS)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) consensus mechanism. When the merge occurs the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism will be fully deprecated and all blocks on Ethereum will be produced via proof-of-stake (PoS).
