The Merge is an upgrade to Ethereum that swaps out the current Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism with a more eco-friendly, efficient, and secure Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This means that the current Proof of Work consensus mechanism is deprecated, and all blocks on Ethereum will be produced by stakers, not miners.
