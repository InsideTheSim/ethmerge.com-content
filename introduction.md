The Ethereum network will undergo its arguably most massive upgrade since its inception in 2015, swapping the energy-intensive Proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the Proof-of-stake (PoS) one, placing a renewed emphasis on decentralization and security, lowering the hardware cost to run a node as well as laying the groundwork to tackle the scalability issue aka the [blockchain trilemma](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/)

The Ethereum "2.0" beacon chain running on Proof-of-stake is already live, [secured by millions of ETH](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-2-0-deposit-contract-tops-5-5b-staked-ether) and is [reaching consensus](https://beaconcha.in/) on its own amongst its 100K+ validators since December 2020.

The Merge refers to the merging of the current PoW chain to the PoS chain and is becoming a very active research & development area for the various teams involved in Ethereum !
